# scriptcraft_scripts

A collection of [ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/)
scripts to enhance your (or maybe just my) Minecraft experience!

## farts.js
A global fart monitor. This script adds two commands to the game:

+ `/jsp fart`: The player farts, raising his or her fart level.
+ `/jsp sniff`: The player inhales deeply, gathering a sense of the global fart 
  level. This command displays the fart leaderboard for the server.
